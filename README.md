# automated-boxing-scoring-system
Gemini บอกว่า This Python script is an automated boxing scoring system using YOLOv8-pose and OpenCV. It tracks two players via dual-camera feeds, using HSV color masks to identify teams and IOU tracking to prevent identity swaps. Scores are triggered by a "pull-back" state machine that monitors hand-to-body distance in centimeters.
