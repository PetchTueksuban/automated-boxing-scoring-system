# 🥊 Automated Boxing Scoring System
The Automated Boxing Scoring System is an innovative solution designed to modernize combat sports officiating. By leveraging technology to minimize human error and subjectivity, this system provides a data-driven approach to scoring boxing matches based on precision, impact, and volume.  

# 🌟 Key Features
* Real-time Scoring: Instantaneous score calculation during the bout.
* Punch Classification: Automatic recognition of punch types (Jab, Cross, Hook, Uppercut).
* Accuracy Tracking: Measures landing precision versus total attempts.
* Impact Analysis: Evaluates the force and effectiveness of landed strikes (Hardware dependent).
* Post-Match Analytics: Comprehensive statistical breakdown for coaches and athletes.  

# 🛠 Tech Stack
* Language: Python 3
* Computer Vision: OpenCV / MediaPipe (for pose estimation and strike detection
* Deep Learning: TensorFlow or PyTorch (for punch recognition models)
* Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
* UI/Visualization: Matplotlib / Streamlit (or your preferred dashboard tool)
